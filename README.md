# Car-Price-Prediction-using-Regularization

Instruction

Problem Statement:
	The CarDekho company maintains a database of the cars sold through their platform. The data represents the cars sold by Car Dekho and the car related features. 	We have to build a linear regression model to predict the Selling price of the car. Calculate all the error metrics and diagnostic plots to check the regression result. The dataset contains data for around 301 cars sold by CarDekho.
 
Data Description:
	Car_Name: Name of the cars.
	Year: Year of the car when it was bought.
	Selling_Price: Price at which the car is being sold.
	Present_Price: Current ex-showroom price of the car.
	Kms_Driven: Distance completed by the car in km.
	Fuel_Type: Fuel type of the car.
	Seller_Type: Tells if a Seller is Individual or a Dealer.
	Transmission: Gear transmission of the car (Automatic/Manual).
	Owner: Number of previous owners of the car.

Tasks/Activities List:
	-Your code should contain the following activities/Analysis:
	-Read the cars dataset
	-Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) - Show the Data quality check, treat the missing values, etc if any
	-Transform the categorical data
	-Apply the Multiple Linear Regression model with and without regularizations (Ridge, Lasso and Elasticnet)
	-Print the model results
	-Get the feature importance
	-Compare all the models using the Sum of Squared Error metric

Success Metrics:
Below are the metrics for the successful submission of this case study:
	-Sum of Squared Error metric for the best model < 5000
 	-The R-squared of the best model > 0.8
